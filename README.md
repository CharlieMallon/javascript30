# JavaScript30
This is to document my journey through the [free 30 Day Vanilla JS Challenge](https://javascript30.com/). I will be attempting to do it in 30 days.
I will add each of the challenges as I do them and give a overview of what each one is and what i would like to add to it in here.

At some point I will also add a nice navigation bar, overview on the page and nice landing page (its just boiler plate for now)

## Challenges
